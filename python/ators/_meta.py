    This metaclass computes the memory layout of the members in a given
    class so that the BaseAtors class can allocate exactly enough space for
    the object data slots when it instantiates an object.

    All classes deriving from Ators are automatically slotted, which prevents
    the creation of an instance dictionary and also the ability of an Ators to
    be weakly referenceable.

    Support for weak references can be enabled by passing enable_weakrefs=True
    to the metaclass constructor, instance dictionary and additional slots are
    not supported.
